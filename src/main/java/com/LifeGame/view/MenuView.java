/*** ****************************************************************
 *  A MenuSite is a frame that holds a menu bar.
 *  Other objects in
 *	the system (which do not have to be visual objects) can negotiate
 *	with the MenuSite to have menu's placed on the site's menu
 *  bar (or within submenus already found on the menu bar). These
 *  objects can easily remove the menu modifications they've made.
 *  <p>
 *  The MenuSite is a static Singleton. You cannot create one
 *  with <code>new</code>---It's made up entirely of <code>static</code>
 *  methods which you can access globally.
 *	<p>
 *  The first thing you must do is tell the system
 *  which JFrame will host the menu bar by calling
 *  {@link #establish MenuSite.establish(mainFrame)}. For example:
 *  <PRE>
 *  public class mainFrame extends JFrame
 *  {	public mainFrame()
 *    {	MenuSite.establish( this );
 *			//...
 *    }
 *  }
 *  </PRE>
 *  Once a menu site is established,
 *  objects that create user interfaces can add items
 *  to the menu site by calling {@link #addLine addLine(...)}
 *  (or more rarely, {@link #addMenu addMenu(...)}). In the
 *  following example, an <code>EmployeeManager</code> object
 *  adds an "Employee" menu that has two submenus: "Hire" and
 *  "Fire"
 *  <PRE>
 *  public class EmployeeManager
 *  {
 *  	public EmployeeManager()
 *    {	MenuSite.addLine( this, "Employee",		 null )
 *  		MenuSite.addLine( this, "Employee:Hire," HireListener );
 *  		MenuSite.addLine( this, "Employee:Fire," FireListener );
 *    }
 *
 *  }
 *  </PRE>
 *	The <code>HireListener</code> and <code>FireListener</code>
 *	objects implement {@link java.awt.event.ActionListener}, and
 *	are notified when the menu item is selected.
 *	<p>
 *  There's (deliberatly) no way to remove individual menu items.
 *  When the object that added items shuts down it's user interface,
 *  it issues a single call to {@link #removeMyMenus removeMyMenus}
 *  to remove <i>all</i> the menus and line items it added.
 *  <p>
 *  The creating object can also issue a
 *  {@link #setEnable} call to disable (or enable) all
 *  menu and menus it created.
 *  <p><b>Important:</b> A referece to the object that asked for
 *  the menu item to be inserted is passed into most of the methods
 *  of this class as the <code>requester</code> argument. The
 *  requester is used as a "key" in a hash table, and the hash-table
 *  lookup method uses both the object's <code>equals()</code> and
 *  <code>hashcode()</code> methods to do the lookup. For things
 *  to work properly, the object used as a requester should
 *  not implement <code>equals()</code>. Java visual objects
 *  like JComponent work fine as a requester, but be careful if
 *  you use an object of a class of your own devising. Solve the
 *  problem as follows:
 *  <PRE>
 *  class MyClass
 *  {	public boolean equals() { ... }
 *
 *		private final Object requesterId = new Object();
 *		public f()
 *        {	// Use requesterId instead of "this."
 *			MenuSite.addLine( requesterId, ... );
 *        }
 *    }
 *  </PRE>
 *	<p>If you haven't worked with menus before, bear in mind that
 *	menu items and menus have both a "name" and also a "label."
 *	The label is visible to the program's user, the name is
 *	an arbitrary internal string. In an internationalized application,
 *	the label will change with the local, but the name will
 *	be fixed. The current classes use only the menu "name." If you don't
 *	do anything special, the name is used as the label. You can provide
 *	a file that maps names to arbitrary strings (and also defines
 *	menu shortcuts) by calling {@link #mapNames mapNames(...)}.

    /*** *************************************************************
     *  Establishes a "map" of (hidden) names to (visible) labels and

     *  Establishing a map changes the behavior of
     *  {@link #addLine addLine(...)} and
     *  {@link #addMenu addMenu(...)} and
     *  in that the specified label
     *  and shortcut are installed automatically for all names specified
     *  in the table.
     *  A map must be specified before the item named in the map
     *  are added to the menu site.
     *  You may call this method multiple times to load multiple maps,
     *  but the "name" component of each entry must be unique across
     *  all maps.
     *
     *  @param table a Properties-style file that maps named
     *  keys to labels, along with an optional
     *  shortcuts. The general form is:
     *  <PRE>
     *  name.1 = label One; C
     *  name.2 = label Two; Alt X
     *  </PRE>
     *  The shortcut can be specified in one of two ways. If it's
     *  a single character, as in the first example, above,
     *  the platform-default modifier is used. For example, in the
     *  first example, the shortcut will be a Ctrl-C in Windows,
     *  a Command-C on the Mac, etc.
     *  Otherwise, the shortcut specifier must take the form described
     *  in {@link javax.swing.KeyStroke#getKeyStroke(String)}.
     *  For example:
     *  <PRE>
     *  F1
     *  control DELETE
     *  alt shift X
     *  alt shift released X
     *  typed a
     *  </PRE>
     *  Names like DELETE and F1 are shorthand for VK_DELETE and VK_F1.
     *  (The complete set of VK_<i>xxx</i> constants are found in the
     *  {@link java.awt.event.KeyEvent} class.) You can use any of
     *  these "virtual" keys simply by removing the VK_.
     *	<p>
     *  For reasons that are mysterious to me, F10 is hard mapped
     *  to display the main menu (so that you can navigate the
     *  menus with the arrow keys). You could probably defeat this
     *  behavior with a key binding, but it's easier to just
     *  accept it as a fait accompli, and not try to define F10 as
     *  a keyboard "shortcut."
     *  <p>
     *  The input file is a standard "Properties" file, which is
     *  assumed to be ISO 8859-1 (not Unicode) encoded.
     *  See {@link java.util.Properties#load} for a full
     *  description of the file format.
